When I updated to the 64-bit MacOS version, I needed to find some way to use YNAB on the new system because it is 32-bit.

I remember finding some git repository that had a command to run to convert it to 64 bit. The conversion described was rewrapping the app in a 64 bit Adobe runtime instead of a 32 bit one.

When using a new Mac, ensure that the script(s) above look okay before running and integrating into the install process.
